\begin{frame}[t]{The perceptron as a computational unit}

    The function computed by the \index{perceptron}\gls{perceptron},
    as well as the learning process, is similar to that of several
    other types of \index{linear model}\glspl{linear model} in \gls{ml}.
    
    The \gls{perceptron} can be seen as a {\bf computational unit}.
    
    We can combine multiple units and create more powerful models.

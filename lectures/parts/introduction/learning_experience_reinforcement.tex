    Learning paradigm: Reinforcement learning - }

    In certain cases, a \index{ML}\gls{ml} algorithm 
    {\bf does not experience a fixed dataset}.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Instead, the \gls{ml} algorithm is allowed to 
    {\bf interact with an environment} and learn from these interactions.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    The term {\bf \index{reinforcement learning}\gls{reinforcement learning}}
    describes this learning paradigm.\\

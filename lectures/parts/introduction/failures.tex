%     Neural nets evolved to classify edible and poisonous 
%     mushrooms took advantage of the data being presented 
%     in alternating order, and didn't actually learn any 
%     features of the input images \cite{Lehman:2019Surprising}

%     PlayFun algorithm deliberately dies in the Bubble Bobble 
%     game as a way to teleport to the respawn location

%     Creatures bred for speed grow really tall and 
%     generate high velocities by falling over
%     \item 
%     In an artificial life simulation where survival required 
%     energy but giving birth had no energy cost, one species 
%     evolved a sedentary lifestyle that consisted mostly of 
%     mating in order to produce new children which could be 
%     eaten (or used as mates to produce more edible children).

%     Agent kills itself at the end of level 1 to avoid losing in level 2

%     In a football game, the player is supposed to try 
%     to score a goal against the goalie, one-on-one. 
%     Instead, the player kicks it out of bounds. 
%     Someone from the other team has to throw the 
%     ball in (in this case the goalie), so now the player has a clear shot at the goal.

%     Rewarding a football robot for touching the ball 
%     caused it to learn to get to the ball and vibrate 
%     touching it as fast as possible

%     CycleGAN algorithm for converting aerial photographs 
%     into street maps and back, trained to minimise the cyclic 
%     consistency loss, encoded output information in the intermediary 
%     image without it being humanly detectable.

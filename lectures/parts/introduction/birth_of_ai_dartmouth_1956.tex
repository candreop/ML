                feature of intelligence can in principle 
                be so precisely described that a machine can be made 
                to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how 
                to make machines use language, form abstractions and 
                concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, 
                and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance 
                can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully 
                selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer."\\

\begin{frame}[t]{Learning by experience}

    A \index{ML}\gls{ml} algorithm can {\bf learn from experience}.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Often, this should be understood as {\bf experiencing a dataset}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \small
        \item 
        A dataset is a collection of {\bf several data examples} (or data ``points").\\
        \item 
        Each example can contain a number of {\bf features}.
        \item 
        Extra {\bf labels} may or may not be associated with each data example.\\
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.1cm}
    Depending on the type of experience,
    we typically distinguish between:\\
    \vspace{0.1cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
        \index{supervised learning}{\bf \gls{supervised learning}},
        \item 
        \index{unsupervised learning}{\bf \gls{unsupervised learning}}, and
        \item 
        \index{reinforcement learning}{\bf \gls{reinforcement learning}}.\\
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.1cm}
    These terms are not formally defined and, as it will be discussed shortly, 
    the {\bf distinction is often blurred}.\\

            In this \gls{ml} task, a model processes a set of data examples
            and {\bf flags some of them as being unusual}.

            Example applications include, amongst many others,
            video surveillance and the detection of 
            credit card fraud, 
            intrusion, or 
            irregularities in the operation of complex machinery.

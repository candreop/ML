    Learning paradigm: Supervised learning - }

\index{supervised learning}\Gls{supervised learning} algorithms
experience a dataset where each example ${\vect{x}}$ 
is associated with a  {\bf label} (or {\bf target}) $\vect{y}$.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

The labels, are provided by the \index{ML}\gls{ml} practitioner 
in order to {\bf instruct the model how to behave}.\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item It is in that sense that learning is {\bf supervised}. 
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}

In this learning paradigm, the \gls{ml} model learns to predict 
$\vect{y}$ for a given $\vect{x}$ by 
{\bf estimating the conditional probability $p(\vect{y}|\vect{x})$}.

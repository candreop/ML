    A \index{ML}\gls{ml} algorithm 
    is one {\bf that is able to learn from data}.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    An algorithm is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to
    some class of tasks $T$ and performance metric $P$, 
    {\bf if its performance, as measured by $P$, at tasks in $T$,
    improves with experience $E$.}\\ 
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    Clearly, this can encompass a huge variety of examples\\

    Learning paradigm: Unsupervised learning - }

    On the other hand, 
    in \index{unsupervised learning}\gls{unsupervised learning},
    an algorithm experiences a dataset where the is 
    {\bf no label associated to each example}.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    Undirected, the algorithm 
    {\bf discovers useful properties of the dataset}.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    In this learning paradigm, by observing many 
    examples ${\vect{x}}$, the \gls{ml} model is attempting to
    {\bf learn the data generating probability 
    distribution $p(\vect{x})$} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item or, simply, to learn certain interesting properties of that distribution.\\
    \end{itemize}

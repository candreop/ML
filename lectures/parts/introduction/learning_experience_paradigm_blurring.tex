    Learning paradigm blurring - }

    The previously used terms of
    \index{supervised learning}\gls{supervised learning},
    \index{unsupervised learning}\gls{unsupervised learning}, and
    \index{reinforcement learning}\gls{reinforcement learning}
    are {\bf not formally defined.}\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    Indeed the {\bf boundaries are blurred}, especially between
    \gls{supervised learning} and \gls{unsupervised learning},
    and many technologies can perform both tasks.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    Recall that in \gls{supervised learning} the algorithm learns
    the conditional probability $p(\vect{y}|\vect{x})$, whereas in
    \gls{unsupervised learning} it learns the 
    probability distribution  $p(\vect{x})$.\\

    \begin{equation}
        p(\vect{x}) = p(x_1 | x_2, \dots, x_n) p(x_2, \dots, x_n)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
        p(\vect{x}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i | x_2, \dots, x_{i-1})
    \end{equation}

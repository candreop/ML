\begin{frame}[t,allowframebreaks]{Supervised learning for binary classification -}

    Consider the following problem. You have:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a {\bf vector of $d$ feature variables}, $\vect{x}$ = $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_d)^T$, and
        \item a {\bf single binary variable} $y$ ($\in$ \{-1, +1\}).   
    \end{itemize}
    The binary variable $y$ \underline{depends on} the feature variables $\vect{x}$.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}

    \begin{blockexample}{}
        \small
        For example:
        \begin{itemize}
            \small
            \item 
                $\vect{x}$: properties of a tumor imaged using computed tomography\\ 
                $y$: is the tumor is benign or malignant?
            \item 
                $\vect{x}$: features of an event observed in a particle physics detector\\ 
                $y$: is the event a new physics candidate 
                  or Standard Model background?
            \item 
                $\vect{x}$: details about a credit card transaction, such
                   as time, amount, location, and frequency of past transactions\\
                $y$: is the transaction fraudulent?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{blockexample}

    Consider the following problem. You have:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a {\bf vector of $d$ feature variables}, $\vect{x}$ = $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_d)^T$, and
        \item a {\bf single binary variable} $y$ ($\in$ \{-1, +1\}).   
    \end{itemize}
    The binary variable $y$ \underline{depends on} the feature variables $\vect{x}$.\\
    \vspace{0.4cm}
    We may have a \index{training set}\gls{training set} $\mathbb{D}$ that 
    consists of several ($\vect{x}$,$y$) examples.\\
    \begin{blockexample}{}
        \small
        For instance, we may have accumulated ($\vect{x}$,$y$) examples:
        \begin{itemize}
            \small
            \item from historical observations, or
            \item from simulations
        \end{itemize}
    \end{blockexample}  
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Can we use the \gls{training set} to {\bf learn the mapping} from $\vect{x}$ to $y$?\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    If we knew that mapping, we could apply it to new instances of $\vect{x}$
    for which $y$ is not known and needs to be predicted.

    Another property of an estimator is its \index{variance}\gls{variance}.\\

    \begin{equation}
        var(\vect{\hat{\theta}}_{\mathbb{X}_{m}}) = 
          \mathbb{E}(\vect{\hat{\theta}}_{\mathbb{X}_{m}}) - \vect{\theta}
        \label{eq:variance}
    \end{equation}\\
    
    It is a measure of how much our estimation 
    would vary if repeated with independent data samples from 
    the same data-generating process.

    The square root of \gls{variance} is known as 
    the \index{standard error}\gls{standard error}.

    Ideally, we prefer

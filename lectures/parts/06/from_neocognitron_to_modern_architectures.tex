\begin{frame}[t,allowframebreaks]{From the Neocognitron to modern architectures -}

    The \index{neocognitron}\gls{neocognitron} 
    was an important development towards high-performing neural network
    architectures for computer vision.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Many key ideas are employed in modern architectures:    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Creating a hierarchical network organisation
        \item Learning simple image features and combining them to produce more complex representations
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    
    The \gls{neocognitron} 
    also differed from modern 
    \index{CNN}\index{convolutional neural network}\glspl{cnn}
    in important ways:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not using the backpropagation training method
        \item Not using weight sharing
    \end{itemize}

    First fully convolutional architecture (\gls{LeNet-5}) was developed circa 2000.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Since then, \index{CNN}\index{convolutional neural network}\glspl{cnn}
    grew in prominence and achieved astonishing accuracy.\\
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Indeed, \glspl{cnn} have been consistent winners
    of the \index{ILSVRC}\index{ImageNet}\gls{ilsvrc}.\\ 
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Some well-known architectures are listed below:\\

    \begin{itemize}

        \item 
        \index{LeNet-5}\gls{LeNet-5}\cite{LeCun:1998ln5};
        First fully convolutional architecture 

        \item 
        \index{AlexNet}\gls{AlexNet}\cite{Krizhevsky:2012alexnet};
        Winner of \gls{ilsvrc} for 2012.
    
        \item 
        \index{ZFNet}\gls{ZFNet}\cite{Zaremba:2016zfnet};
        Winner of \gls{ilsvrc} for 2013.
    
        \item 
        \index{GoogLeNet}\gls{GoogLeNet} 
        (or \index{Inception}\gls{Inception} v1)
        \cite{Szegedy:2014gnet};
        Winner of \gls{ilsvrc} for 2014.
    
        \item 
        \index{VGG}\gls{VGG}\cite{Simonyan:2015vgg};
        A close second of \gls{ilsvrc} for 2014.
    
        \item 
        \index{ResNet}\gls{ResNet}\cite{He:2016resnet};
        Winner of \gls{ilsvrc} for 2015.    
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{0.2cm}
    Some of these architectures will be discussed in detail later.

\begin{frame}[t,allowframebreaks]{Convolutional Neural Networks}

    A \index{CNN}\index{convolutional neural network}\gls{cnn} 
    is a specialised type of deep neural network designed for use 
    with {\bf grid-structured inputs}.\\
    Examples include:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf time series} (1-D grid-structured data), or 
      \item {\bf images} (2-D grid-structured data).
    \end{itemize}

    The vast majority of \gls{cnn} applications focusses on image data.
    In this type of data exhibits:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some degree of {\bf similarity in adjacent grid locations}.\\
          {\it For example, neighbouring pixels often have a similar colour.}
        \item A degree of {\bf translation invariance}.\\
          {\it For example, our interpretation of an object as a "cat"
          does not depend on where it appears on the image.}
    \end{itemize}

    \framebreak

    \glspl{cnn} use \index{convolution} \gls{convolution}
    operations in at least one of their layers.
    Convolution:
    \begin{itemize}
     \item is used in place of general matrix multiplication,
     \item enables parameter sharing 
    \end{itemize}
